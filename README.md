Game Rules

Game Setup:

The game is played on an 8x8 board.

Initial setup places two black ('X') and two white ('O') discs in the center of the board.

Game Play:

Players take turns placing a disc of their color on the board.

A valid move must capture one or more of the opponent's discs. This happens when the placed disc and another disc of the same color surround one or more of the opponent's discs in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

Captured discs are flipped to the player's color.

End of Game:

The game ends when neither player can make a valid move.
The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins.
If both players have the same number of discs, the game is a tie.
